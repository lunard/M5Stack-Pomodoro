# M5Stack-Pomodoro
This project aims to create a funny (and hope useful) Pomodoro with the M5Stack dev kit.
Pomodoro is a "tool" used by developer to set a count down defining how long work hard without any distraction (also by collegues).

This project uses my WiFiHelper library https://github.com/lunard/WiFiHelper

Side by side with that library, you can discover:
- connect to a WiFi
- setup the internal clock using a NTP
- write and read JSON serialized and deserialized configuration on file 
- use images to make the M5Stack dynamic
- download images from Unsplash API (https://source.unsplash.com/) 
- show a funny progress bar
- use the gyroscope to detect the 4 main orientations UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT

I hope this project could be useful.
